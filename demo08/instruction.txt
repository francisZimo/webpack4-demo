HTML Webpack Plugin and Open Browser Webpack Plugin
This demo shows you how to load 3rd-party plugins.
html-webpack-plugin could create index.html for you, and open-browser-webpack-plugin could open a new browser tab when Webpack loads.


Now you don't need to write index.html by hand and don't have to open browser by yourself. Webpack did all these things for you.
